# Emergency Blood Donors
Members: Cathy Lu, Deepthi Pittala, Marc Cardenas, Patricia Ouyang

## Problem Addressed
Most hospitals rely on blood banks and blood drives as a reliable source of blood. However, blood drives may not always occur at the most convenient times or places for potential donors and may not coincide with times of need for hospitals when supplies are low.

## Solution Built
Our web app allows hospitals to alert potential donors when they need blood so that donors can donate blood quickly and at the most optimal times. The web app allows for emergency donor registration and hospital registration. When hospitals determine that they need a certain type of blood, they can send out an alert with the blood specifications to all donors that are a match. The donors are immediately able to see which hospitals sent which notifications and can then decide when and where to donate blood.

## Problem Solved
Donors get paid for their contributions while the hospitals get a steady stream of blood and ensure that they are never critically short on supplies. In other words, there would be an increased availability of health care resources during an emergency. This in effect gets IBM more involved with the healthcare and support community. This helps people around the world gain awareness about IBM’s social initiatives and learn more about the impact of IBM’s technologies.

## Technology and IBM Services used
  - Cloudant database used to store user data, hospital data, and other relevant information
  - Cloud Foundry container using node.js sdk

## Future implementations
Due to the short amount of time during the hackathon there were many features we had planned for our project but are not yet fully functioning. We could also make several improvements and extensions of our web app. Some improvements include better real-time notifications to donors based on location data to find the closest hospital alerts. A possible feature that we could add in the future is emergency planning that uses location data to find local hospitals that would route resources to the disaster site. We also thought that this web app could be ported to mobile devices as a mobile app so that users and hospitals can use the app features on-the-go, from any location. We hope to implement these ideas in the near future to improve our product’s functionality and enhance the user experience.
